Question 1
While the code in The repeat function exercise uses a function to generate random numbers, which of the following is a valid output for the wheel spin attempts?

1 / 1 point

Attempt 1: 3.25

Attempt 2: 6.5

Attempt 3: 8


Attempt 1: 4 

Attempt 2: 8

Attempt 3: 5


Attempt 1: 3 

Attempt 2: 10

Attempt 3: 8

Correct
Correct! Random.nextInt(10) can return integer values from 0 to 9.

2.
Question 2
Which of the following is the correct function definition for the repeat function?

1 / 1 point

fun repeat(times: Int, action: () -> Unit)


fun repeat(times: Int, action: (Int) -> Unit)


fun repeat(action: (Int) -> Unit)

Correct
Correct! The first parameter represents the number of iterations and the second parameter represents a function type which takes in an integer parameter with its value as the index position in the iteration.

Question 3
Which of the following constructs is the repeat function similar to? 

1 / 1 point

While loop


For loop


If statement

Correct
Correct! The repeat function is similar to a for loop where you define the number of iterations beforehand.

Question 1
What is a higher-order function?

1 / 1 point

A function that depends on another function for its output.


A function that takes functions as parameters, or returns a function.


A higher-order function is a function that does not return any value.

Correct
Correct! A higher-order function is a functional programming concept that allows function to be passed just as objects of other data types.

Question 2
Which of these is a correct way to call the function greet:

12345678910
  fun greet(name: String, function: (name: String) -> Unit) { function(name)}  fun print(name: String) { println("Hello $name")}


fun greet(name: String, function: (name: String) -> Unit) {
 function(name)
}


fun print(name: String) {
 println("Hello $name")
}

1 / 1 point

greet { print(it) } (“Joe”)


greet("Joe", print)


greet("Joe") { println("Hi $it") }

Correct
Correct! You can pass a function as a lambda expression to a higher-order function.


greet("Joe", ::print)

Correct
Correct! You can use the :: operator to obtain the reference of a function.

3.
Question 3
Which of the following constructs is the repeat function similar to? 

1 / 1 point

for loop 


while loop 


If statement 

Correct
Correct! The repeat function is similar to a for loop where you define the number of iterations beforehand. 

4.
Question 4
What is the output of the following code?

123456
val number = 2var output = 1repeat(3) { index -> output += (index * number)}println(output)
val number = 2
var output = 1
repeat(3) { index ->
 output += (index * number)
}
println(output)

1 / 1 point
