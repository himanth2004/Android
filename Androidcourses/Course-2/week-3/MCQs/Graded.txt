Question 1
Which of these are correct ways to instantiate a function type. Select all that apply.

0.75 / 1 point

Using instance of a user defined class that implements a function type as an interface.

Correct
Correct! You can instantiate a function using a defined class that implements a function type as an interface.


Using the function name.

This should not be selected
Not quite. You cannot instantiate a function type by using the function name directly. Check the video item ‘Function types’ to recap on your learning.


Using a lambda expression.

Correct
Correct! You can use a lambda expression to instantiate a function type.


Using a callable reference to existing declaration using the ‘::’ operator

Correct
Correct! You can use a callable reference such as ‘::functionName’.

2.
Question 2
Which of these is a correct usage of lambda expression for the given function definition?

123
fun execute(number: Int, function: (Int) -> String) { println(function(number))}
fun execute(number: Int, function: (Int) -> String) {
 println(function(number))
}

1 / 1 point

execute("Score") { "$it 100" }


execute(100) { "Score $it" }


execute(100) ( "Score $it" )

Correct
Correct! The above function takes in an ‘Int’ argument and then prints a string by concatenating it with the ‘Score’.

3.
Question 3
Which of the these is a correct lambda expression syntax?

1 / 1 point

val difference: (Int, Int) -> Int = x: Int, y: Int -> { x - y }


val difference: (Int, Int) -> Int = x: Int, y: Int -> x - y


val difference: (Int, Int) -> Int = { x: Int, y: Int -> x - y }

Correct
Correct! This is the correct syntax

4.
Question 4
Which listener interface provided by the Android framework is used to listen for a button press event?

1 / 1 point

View.OnPressListener


View.OnClickListener


View.OnTapListener

Correct
Correct! The ‘View’ class contains an interface ‘OnClickListener’ that has a method ‘onClick’ which gets called on events such as a button press.

5.
Question 5
Which of these are higher-order functions? Select all that apply.

0.75 / 1 point

fun display(): (Int) -> Unit

Correct
Correct! This is a higher-order function as it returns a function.


fun display(x: (Int) -> Unit)

Correct
Correct! This is a higher-order function as it takes another function as a parameter.


fun display(x: Int) : Unit

This should not be selected
Not quite. This is not a higher-order function as it neither takes in a function as an input nor returns one. Please check video item ‘What is higher-order-function' to recap on your learning.


fun display(x: (Int)) -> Unit

6.
Question 6
What is the output of this code?


1234567
val number = 3var output = 2repeat(5) { index -> output += (index * number)}println(output) 
val number = 3
var output = 2
repeat(5) { index ->
 output += (index * number)
}
println(output)

Question 7
What is the output of the following code?


1234567
var sum = 0 val numberList = listOf(1, 4, 6, 7, 9) numberList.forEach { number -> sum += number}println(sum)
var sum = 0

val numberList = listOf(1, 4, 6, 7, 9) 
numberList.forEach { number ->
 sum += number
}
println(sum)

1 / 1 point

27


9


1

Correct
Correct! The above code would iterate over each element and then add each element’s value to variable named ‘sum’.

8.
Question 8
What is the output of this code:

1234567891011121314
data class Chocolate(  val flavor: String,  val price: Int ) val list = listOf(  Chocolate("Dark", 7),  Chocolate("Milk", 4),  Chocolate("Coffee", 2) )val output = list.map {  it.flavor } println(output) 
data class Chocolate( 
 val flavor: String, 
 val price: Int 
) 
val list = listOf( 
 Chocolate("Dark", 7), 
 Chocolate("Milk", 4), 
 Chocolate("Coffee", 2) 
)
val output = list.map { 


1 / 1 point

[Chocolate(flavor=Dark, price=7), Chocolate(flavor=Milk, price=4), Chocolate(flavor=Coffee, price=2)]


[7, 4, 2]


[Dark, Milk, Coffee]

Correct
Correct! The above code transforms the initial list to a new list that contains values of 'flavor’.

9.
Question 9
What is the output of this code:

1234567891011121314
data class Chocolate(  val flavor: String,  val price: Int ) val list = listOf(  Chocolate("Dark", 7),  Chocolate("Milk", 4),  Chocolate("Coffee", 2) )val output = list.filter {  it.price > 3} println(output) 
data class Chocolate( 
 val flavor: String, 
 val price: Int 
) 
val list = listOf( 
 Chocolate("Dark", 7), 
 Chocolate("Milk", 4), 
 Chocolate("Coffee", 2) 
)
val output = list.filter { 


1 / 1 point

[Chocolate(flavor=Dark, price=7), Chocolate(flavor=Milk, price=4), Chocolate(flavor=Coffee, price=2)]


[Chocolate(flavor=Dark, price=7), Chocolate(flavor=Milk, price=4)]


[Chocolate(flavor=Coffee, price=2)]

Correct
Correct! The code above filters the 'chocolate’ elements that have ‘price’ > 3, and returns a new list with only those elements that comply to the condition.

10.
Question 10
What is the output of this code: 

123456
val list = listOf(9, 3, 1, 6) val output = list.fold(1) { x, y ->  x + y } println(output) 
val list = listOf(9, 3, 1, 6) 
val output = list.fold(1) { x, y -> 
 x + y 
} 
println(output)


1 / 1 point

1


18


20

Correct
Correct! The fold function accumulates a value starting from the initial value of ‘1’ and then applies the operation to each element in the list.
